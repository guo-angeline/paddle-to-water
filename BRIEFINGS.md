# Briefings: the board log

CEO briefings after each shipped or parked item, newest first, 15 lines max each.

## 2026-07-04T03:18:00Z · Alert deep-link interstitial shipped (item 1)
What: composeAlert now embeds the calm-window label in the push's deep-link URL; a new AlertInterstitial card shows it plus the spot's put-in notes and a Get Directions shortcut over the drawer, behind the `alert_interstitial` A/B flag (control = no change). New events alert_interstitial_shown/result.
Verification: npm test (44 passed), npm run lint (clean), npm run build (clean; new event strings confirmed in .next/static).
Not deployed: this PR only merges code. Production is unchanged until the owner runs `vercel --prod --yes`.
Next up: item 2 (next-good-window in the conditions panel) is top of the ready queue.

## 2026-07-02 · Studio enabled on this project
What: ROADMAP.md is now the studio backlog (items 1, 2, 4 ready; 3, 5 parked; Later section proposed). DECISIONS.md and .claude/studio.md created.
Next up: item 1, fix the 58% landing bounce.
